I want to create a fitness dashboard app that helps users optimize their fitness journey towards their goals, either 'lose fat' or 'gain muscle'. The app should integrate with existing fitness apps and devices to collect data in three key categories: Rest & Recovery, Diet, and Workout. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the requirements based on the provided images:

General Requirements:
User Interface (UI):

Ensure consistent font, style, and color coding across all sections of the app.
The app should have four main sections: Dashboard, Statistics, Goals, and Settings.
Data Collection and Integration:

Integrate with popular fitness and health apps (e.g., Apple Health, Google Fit, MyFitnessPal, Fitbit).
Collect relevant data for each category:
Rest & Recovery: Sleep duration, quality, rest days, active recovery activities.
Diet: Net calories, macronutrient breakdown, meal logging.
Workout: Frequency, duration, intensity, types of exercises.
Section 1: Dashboard
Overall View:
Display an overall efficiency score as a percentage, representing the user's progress towards their fitness goal.
Use a circular progress indicator to show the efficiency score.
Display progress bars for each of the three categories (Rest & Recovery, Diet, Workout) with percentage values indicating their optimization status.
Section 2: Statistics
Detailed View:
Provide detailed statistics for each category.
Display metrics such as total steps, stand hours, active calories, sleep duration, workout intensity, and dietary intake.
Use intuitive graphs and charts to visualize data over time.
Section 3: Goals
User Goals:
Display the userâ€™s goals for each category.
Include visual representations (icons) for each goal (e.g., exercise minutes, recovery time, calorie intake).
Allow users to set and track specific goals related to their fitness journey.
Section 4: Settings
Settings Menu:
Allow users to manage their account, connect/disconnect from other fitness apps, set preferences, and configure notifications.
Include options for privacy settings and data management.
Attached Image Reference:
The first screenshot shows the dashboard with the overall efficiency score and progress bars for each category.
The second screenshot shows the detailed statistics view with various metrics.
The third screenshot shows the userâ€™s goals for each category.
Consistency in font, style, and color coding is essential across all sections.
Please use this detailed description and the attached images to create a fitness dashboard app that meets these requirements.
